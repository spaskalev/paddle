# paddle

Paddle is a design experiment in a chorded keyboard using only two keys. The goal for it is to have an accessible and time-insenstive input system. A user that could operate only a single switch at time should still be able to use paddle to input data.

Radio operators can encode data using a single key by using the relative length between keying to distinguish between dits and dahs. To make an input system that is not based on time a second key is added. Starting from the state of (0,0) and finishing at the same state the series of key transitions can be used to encode input.
